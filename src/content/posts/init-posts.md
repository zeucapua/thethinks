The Thinks is yet another tech blog, made so we can discuss the technology we live and work with everyday.
Together, we will write code snippets and tutorials to make our programming lives easier, ask important
questions about ethical and pragmatic implications of new technology, and importantly gain an appreciation
for how the past 100 years of computer science has shaped humanity, for better and worse.
