The Thinks is yet another tech blog, created to we can discuss the technology we live and work with every day.
Together, we will write code snippets and tutorials to make our programming lives easier, ask important
questions about ethical and pragmatic implications of new technology, and importantly gain an appreciation
for how the past 100 years of computer science has shaped humanity, for better and worse.

We'll be using Astro and its amazing content collections features to create this blog, alongside their new
experimental integration for Markdoc compatibility. Part of the goal of this site, other than general discussion,
is to create better tutorials. Stripe (the company behind Markdoc) has amazing documentation that makes their 
explanations of their API easier to understand, and so the tutorials on this site will be heavily inspired by them.
