Twitter became a private company after its board agreed to sell the social media giant for roughly $44 billion to
Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk last year. Ever since, Musk has made (and removed) features that has rocked users and 
the public largely, most perceiving it as negative. Though it seems like Twitter as a social space will stay for the
years to come. Let's ponder why.

## Elon's Tenure so Far

The layoffs that ended 2022 was a big loss for software engineers who worked at the company, either being 
fired over budget cuts or leaving due to the change in their remote work policy. The recommendation algorithm for
tweets was "open-sourced" on GitHub, leading to the revelation that Musk was being boosted disproportionally,
along with other celebrities and politicians, as well as that users were being put in political buckets. 

Moderation seems to be relaxed, at least toward conservatives, leading to a surge in hate speech on the platform[^1],
with little accountability on Twitter as they have gutted various teams responsible for "communications, content
curation, human rights, and machine learning ethics."[^2] Not to mention that the press has to direct line to the 
company after their press email has been changed to automatically respond back to inquiries with a poop emoji (yes,
for real[^3]).

As of writing, the biggest controversy to hit the platform was with former MMA fighter Jake Shields advocating for 
the executions of doctors and teachers of trans kids was screenshotted[^4] by prominent left learning accounts like
@jaubreyYT and @Esqueer_ after a mass of Twitter Blue subscribers were found to agree (which were on top of the 
replies list due to being prioritized). 

Later, it seems that Twitter has taken a special interest in the situation, which would be a bad look into the 
types of people who would buy Twitter Blue, as the images themselves were being removed and users can't look at them.
The tweets themselves stood, but it bore an "error occurred loading this image" message. Software engineer and 
crypto researcher Molly White shows that this was deliberate[^5]. Shields' account is still up despite violating the
Terms of Service (TOS), which is indicated by his original tweets being removed with said reasoning.

This controversy, a new allegation of similar cicumstances surrounding news of SpaceX and the FAA[^6], 
Elon's self proclaimed anti-transgender stance[^7] doesn't bode well to the accusations of favoritism and 
censorship from Twitter's new owner, who bought the platform with the mission of "freedom of speech, not reach"[^8].

## Twitter is THE Real Time Space 

Despite the negative attention the above controversies have created, they do highlight a key advantage of Twitter's
wide reach: news is instant. Anyone can create discourse and anyone can respond to it. This does not occur only to 
those who look for an online fight, but as well as to newsworthy stories. 

News organizations and reporters tweet their hard work into a wider audience that might not have read them 
because of the fragmented ecosystem blocked behind subscription fees. Those on the ground can live 
tweet their first-hand account of important world events, like the Ukranian invasion of Russia or the
police brutality many endured during the Black Lives Matter protests back in 2016.

One could even argue that with the increased visibility and recommendation of conservative voices, amplified as many 
subscribe to Twitter Blue, create a sense of manufactured antagonism that increased potential engagement. Granted, 
that might be thwarted by the so called #BlockTheBlue movement. Even those who oppose Musk and his leadership 
decisions have stayed on the platform, and I believe it is because Twitter is *that* important.
