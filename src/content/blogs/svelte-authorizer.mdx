Authentication in web applications can be daunting. I know it was for me, but after scouring the internet
for great free and open source projects, I think we got a neat solution. 

In today's tutorial, we will be using the open source project [Authorizer](https://authorizer.dev), 
deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app), which you can think about like "[Vercel](https://vercel.com) for the
backend" where you can create databases and services for you to use without the tedious configuration and deployment.

For the web application, we will be using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev), a full stack framework by
[Vercel](https://vercel.com), using the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) UI framework created by
[Rich Harris](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris). 

Svelte and SvelteKit makes web development easy and reactive with
ease. Its decisions when it comes to reserved file names and separation of concerns helps with grasping the mental
model. As a final note, the rest of this blog will assume you know the basics around HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 



Now let's get this started!

## Install and Initial Configuration
### Authorizer and Railway Setup
Before anything, let's get Authorizer set up. 
- Go to [Railway](https://railway.app) and create a new project.
- From here, choose **Deploy a template** and choose **Authorizer**. Once created, the project should have three 
services made, a Redis and Postgres database, and a site hosting the Authorizer dashboard. 
- Open the dashboard and you'll be met with a login screen. 
- Create and enter a new password and login to see your **Client ID**. Keep this in mind and ready for the 
next step of configuration.

### SvelteKit and NPM Package Install
> The following requires you to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed if you want to develop 
this project on your local computer. If you want to just try this out, you can use sites like
[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com) and [Replit](https://replit.com) for online cloud development.

Next up is your web application. To create a SvelteKit project, use the terminal and enter `npm create svelte@latest`
to go through the prompts. I will be using Typescript for this tutorial, but it is not necessary. 

> Images and Diagrams to be added soon.

- Use the terminal to go inside the project folder (eg via `cd`) 
- Install the Authorizer Svelte package: `npm i --save @authorizerdev/authorizer-svelte`. 
- To setup the project for Authorizer, we will need to create a `.env` file in the root of our SvelteKit projects. 
- We will make a few environment variables called `PUBLIC_AUTHORIZER_URL` and `PUBLIC_AUTHORIZER_CLIENT_ID`.
Set the URL to where the Authorizer dashboard is set, which you
can find in your Railway project page, and the client ID can be found inside said dashboard.

## Basic Authorizer Usage
To start using Authorizer, we are going to initialize it using the `AuthorizerProvider` component to wrap
our content. We're going to use it inside a `+layout.svelte` file for now with the following code:

```svelte /src/routes/+layout.svelte
<!-- /src/routes/+layout.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
  // style the Authorizer components; can be configured to your custom theme
  // see https://docs.authorizer.dev/authorizer-svelte#updating-styles
  import "@authorizerdev/authorizer-svelte/styles/default.css";

  // Authorizer Wrapper 
  import { AuthorizerProvider } from "@authorizerdev/authorizer-svelte";
  
  // get our public environment variables using the "$env" Svelte module
  import { PUBLIC_AUTHORIZER_URL, PUBLIC_AUTHORIZER_CLIENT_ID } from "$env/static/public";

</script>


<!-- Let's put it all together! -->
<AuthorizerProvider
  config={{
    authorizerURL: PUBLIC_AUTHORIZER_URL,
    redirectURL: typeof window != "undefined" ? window.location.origin : "",
    clientID: PUBLIC_AUTHORIZER_CLIENT_ID
  }}
>
  <slot />
</AuthorizerProvider>
```

To explain real quick: the `AuthorizerProvider` component is being configured using the `config` attribute
that has our environment variables. We have to name these variables with the `PUBLIC_` prefix since SvelteKit
ensures that there are no real secrets being leaked to the client, so the prefix tells our framework that this
is ok. Inside we can see the `<slot />` tag which is where our children `+page.svelte` files will render in.
Speaking of which...

```svelte
<!-- /src/routes/+page.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
  import { getContext } from "svelte";
  import { Authorizer } from "@authorizerdev/authorizer-svelte";
  import type { AuthorizerState } from "@authorizerdev/authorizer-svelte/types";

  // instantiate Authorizer variables (state and context)
  let auth_state : AuthorizerState;
  let auth_context = getContext("authorizerContext");

  // ensure that state changes when context does
  auth_context.subscribe(
    (data : AuthorizerState) => { auth_state = data; }
  );

  // to logout using Authorizer and changing the context's data
  async function logout() {
    await auth_state.logout();
  }
</script>


{#if auth_state.user}
  <p>{auth_state.user.email}</p>
  <button on:click={logout}>Logout</button>
{:else}
  <Authorizer />
{/if}

```

*Okay, there's a lot going on.* Instead of just talking about the code, let's use a diagram to explain what all these mean.

> Images and Diagrams to be added soon.

As you can see, the `+layout.svelte` is the parent of `+page.svelte`, and it is holding the `AuthorizerProvider`
and with it comes a `authorizerContext` [being set][1]. A [context][2] is used in Svelte to allow parents and 
their children components to pass data between themselves. Parent components, in this case the `+layout.svelte`, 
use `setContext(key, context)`, where "key" is the identifier that points to the "context", 
which is the actual data. In the `AuthorizerProvider`  [component code][3], the "key" is called "authorizerContext" 
which points to an `AuthorizerState` object. That has the [data][4] that will be fetched from your Railway Authorizer instance.

We are going to grab this data in our `+page.svelte` file, the child component, which will be rendered on the client browser by using the
`getContext(key)`. While this is good, this doesn't make the data immediately reactive to any changes (in this case,
any user state changes). Good thing that the context's data is a store, so all we need to do is to `subscribe` to any
changes that happens. After that, it is straightforward! Use an if else block in our HTML to check if our `auth_state`
has a user logged in, then we show the email and add a logout button; otherwise, we will use their `Authorizer` 
component to render the login form.

## Decoupled Data & Cookies
While we can keep our code just like above and have working basic authentication, any application will probably have a separate 
database solution to get user data since Authorizer only stores auth-based information (email, password, account details, etc.); 
in my case, on my current project **Lophop**, I also have a separate PostgresSQL database that has the user's application data 
being used with Prisma ORM. Since my data is architected this way, I connect them using the Authorizer's authentication id.

The way I implemented this is using cookies. From my understanding, cookies are small pieces of persistant data that is stored
in the client's browsers that can be set and accessed by web applications. In this case, we are going to put the user's Authorizer ID
and the access token as cookies and make sure they *expire* when the access token does. To do this, we are going to modify our current pages.

- First we are going to move our current `+layout.svelte` and `+page.svelte` files into a `/login` page folder.
- Let's also add a new `+layout.server.ts` file in the `/login` folder.
- In the `+page.svelte` in the `/routes/root`, we'll add a button that links to the `/login` page. 
- Next, we're going to create a new page folder called `/redirect` that has a `+page.server.ts` and 
`+page.svelte`. Now let's add some code:

```svelte
<!-- /src/routes/+page.svelte -->

<a href="/login">Login</a>
```

```ts
// /src/routes/login/+layout.server.ts
import { redirect } from "@sveltejs/kit";

export async function load({ cookies }) {
  // get cookies, if already set
  const auth_id = cookies.get("auth_id");
  const access_token = cookies.get("access_token");

  // if already set, go to another page
  if (access_token && auth_id) {
    // we will make this "/dashboard" page in the next step
    throw redirect(308, "/dashboard");
  }
}
```

```svelte
<!-- /src/routes/login/+page.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
  // ...other imports 
  // add a new import to navigate to the redirect
  import { goto } from "$app/navigation";

  // ... auth_state & auth_context stuff

  // REMOVE logout function and REPLACE with loginHandler
  // This will be used on both "login" and "signup" actions
  async function authHandler(authResponse : any) {
    const msg = authRepsonse.message;
    if (msg === "Logged in successfully" || msg === "Signed up successfully.") {
      // get relevant data from authResponse 
      const auth_id = authResponse.user.id;
      const access_token = authResponse.access_token;
      const expires_in = authResponse.expires_in;

      // logout with state to ensure any other authentication data isn't accessed anymore
      await auth_state.logout();

      // go to the redirect page with relevant data as URL parameters
      goto(`/redirect/?auth_id=${auth_id}&access_token=${access_token}&expires_in=${expires_in}`);
    }
  }
</script>

<!-- REMOVE previous HTML code and REPLACE with... -->
<Authorizer 
  onLogin={(loginResponse) => authHandler(loginResponse)} 
  onSignup={(signupResponse) => authHandler(signupResponse)}
/>
```

```ts
// /src/routes/redirect/+page.server.ts
import { redirect } from "@sveltejs/kit";

export async function load({ cookies, url }) {
  // get cookies, if already set
  const auth_id = cookies.get("auth_id");
  const access_token = cookies.get("access_token");

  // if cookies already set, go to home page
  // we will make this "/dashboard" page in the next step
  if (auth_id && access_token) { throw redirect(308, "/dashboard"); }
  else {
    // get the URL parameters
    const auth_id = url.searchParams.get("auth_id");
    const access_token = url.searchParams.get("access_token");
    const expires_in = url.searchParams.get("expires_in");

    // if we are in the redirect page with no URL parameters, 
    // go back to /login to ensure we have data.
    if ( !(auth_id && access && expires_in) ) {
      throw redirect(308, "/login");
    }
    
    // other we are going to use the URL parameters that has our relevant data and 
    // set the cookies ourselves and ensure they expire
    cookies.set("auth_id", auth_id, {
      path: "/",
      maxAge: parseInt(expires_in)
    });

    cookies.set("access_token", access_token, {
      path: "/",
      maxAge: parseInt(expires_in)
    });

    // we will make this "/dashboard" page in the next step
    throw redirect(308, "/dashboard");
  }
}
```

```svelte
<!-- /src/routes/redirect/+page.svelte -->
<p>Loading...</p>
```

As you may have noticed, SvelteKit has reserved file names to create a separation of concerns. In this case,
we have files that end with `.svelte`, which renders as components, or with `+layout` and `+page`, render as pages and its 
parent wrapper. We are also using files that end with `.server.ts` (which is Typescript specific, end with `.server.js` for 
Javascript), to access a reserved `load` function where we can set and access the cookies. Note that the `path` is set to `"/"`
so that the cookie is available throughout the entire web application.

Both the `/login` and `/redirect` `.server.ts` files start with checking if there are cookies already set; if so, they 
redirect to the `/dashboard` for automatic login. Otherwise, they continue with their functions: `/login` will render with 
the Authorizer login component, and `/redirect` will set the cookies.

Speaking of which, in the `/redirect` `load` function also allows us to get the data embedded in the URL when being 
navigated to from the `/login` page. To do so, all we need to do is add the `url` parameter and get the data with 
`url.searchParams.get(key)`. So when we navigated to `/redirect/?auth_id=abc&expires_in=123`, we can can code 
`const auth_id = url.searchParams.get("auth_id")` and `const expiry = url.searchParams.get("expires_in")` 
> The data returned is a string, so to use any numbers from the `searchParams`, use something like `parseInt` to turn the 
string into a number you can actually use).

## Authorized Route Access

We have authentication working! Congratulations. Well, not yet. We have a final layer of security: grouped routes. 
[Grouped routes][5] is an advanced maneuver- sorry no, an advanced routing tool that allows us to, well, group routes.
By that I mean that we can use the `+layout.server.ts` file inside these groups as a checker if we can access any of its 
member routes. You can see this in a small example in the [SvelteKit's tutorial][6] on route groups.

In this explainer, we're going to use the group's `+layout.server.ts` to check the cookies and redirect back to the login 
page if they are not found, the same the `/redirect` code . The good thing is that we don't need to redirect when they *are* 
found because this group `+layout.svelte` and `+layout.server.ts` are just a parent wrapper, but invisible to the actual 
route url (you're users aren't going to `https://adc.dev/(authed)/dashboard). Let's write it!

```svelte
<!-- /src/routes/(authed)/+layout.svelte -->
<slot />
```

```ts 
// src/routes/(authed)/+layout.server.ts
import { redirect } from "@sveltejs/kit";

export function load({ cookies }) {
  // get cookies, if already set
  const auth_id = cookies.get("auth_id");
  const access_token = cookies.get("access_token");

  // if not found, go back to /login
  if ( !(access_token && auth_id) ){
    throw redirect(308, "/login");
  }
}
```

```svelte
<!-- /src/routes/(authed)/dashboard/+page.svelte -->
<p>You're in.</p>
```

## Authorizer Logout

The last thing we're going to need is a way for the user to logout. Since our authorization method 
has the access bound via cookies, we are going to have to clear said cookies to "logout". Easiest way
to do so is to have a button attached to a form that removes it. SvelteKit makes this easy with their 
implementation of form actions in the `.server.ts` files.

```svelte
<!-- /src/routes/(authed)/dashboard/+page.svelte -->
<p>You're in.</p>
<form method="POST" action="?/logout">
  <button>Logout</button>
</form>
```

```ts
// /src/routes/(authed)/dashboard/+page.server.ts 
import { redirect, type Actions } from "@sveltejs/kit";

// connects to the Form component on the page
export const actions : Actions = {
  logout: async ({ cookies }) => {
    // clear cookies from client browser
    cookies.delete("auth_id");
    cookies.delete("access_token");

    // go back to home page
    throw redirect(303, "/");
  }
}
```

[tutorial][8]. Maybe in another explainer...

And with all that, we have a working *free* OSS authentication solution with Authorizer and SvelteKit. 
Modern web development is amazing that anyone new (like me) can actually wrap their heads around something 
new and complex fairly easily. 

If you found this explainer useful, please consider giving the 
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/zeucapua/svelte-authorizer-demo) a star, and follw me on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/zeu_dev).Also, I'm fairly new to web development. 
This is **less** of a "tutorial" and more of a way I've learned to make this work for me. If I've fibbed 
on a tech explanation or know of a better solution or why it shouldn't be done this way, please let me know!
I'm always learning!
